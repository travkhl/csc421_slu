    "**Problem:**\n",
    "Five pirates looted a chest full of 100 gold coins. Being a bunch of democratic pirates, they agree on the following method to divide the loot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most senior pirate will propose a distribution of the coins.\n",
    "- All pirates, including the most senior pirate, will then vote.\n",
    "- If at least 50% of the pirates accept the proposal, the gold is divided as proposed.\n",
    "- If not, the most senior pirate will be fed to shark and the process starts over with the next most senior pirate…\n",
    "- The process is repeated until a plan is approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You can assume that all pirates are perfectly rational: **they want to stay alive first and to get as much gold as possible second.** Finally, being blood-thirsty pirates, **they want to have fewer pirates on the boat if given a choice between otherwise equal outcomes.***\n",

    "**Solution:**    \n",
    "When deciding whether to accept a proposal, each pirate reasons as follows:   \n",
    "- If, when it is my turn to propose, my proposal would certainly be rejected, then I will accept a proposal made in an earlier round in order to survive.\n",
    "- If, in the next proposal, I would receive fewer coins and that proposal would certainly be approved, then I will accept the current proposal.\n",

    "By backward induction, we know that:\n",
    "- When only pirate A is left, he takes all the gold.\n",
    "- When pirates AB remain, B can pass a proposal with his own vote. Since B is the proposer, he takes all the gold.\n",
    "- When pirates ABC remain, pirate A would get no gold in the next round. Therefore, A does not want the game to move on and will accept any proposal that gives him some gold. As a result, C proposes to give A one coin, keeps the remaining 99 coins for himself, and gives nothing to B.\n",
    "- When pirates ABCD remain, the same logic applies. D can secure B’s vote by giving him one coin, keep 99 coins for himself, and give nothing to the others.\n",
    "- When all pirates ABCDE are present, E gives one coin each to A and C, who would otherwise receive nothing in the next round, and keeps the remaining 98 coins for himself."
